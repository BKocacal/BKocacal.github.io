    <hr>
    <p>I was born on <b> March 18, 2000</b> (making me a pisces) in Brooklyn, NY. I grew up in a <b> Turkish</b> household and my family decided to move to Clifton, NJ in 2008. I am a third year <b>Architecture student</b> at <b> <a href="https://www.njit.edu/"> NJIT</a></b> pursuing my accelerated B.Arch degree but I have previously studied psychology, next door at Rutgers, for two years. I chose to pursue a more <b> creative field</b> as architecture/interior design have always been an interest of mine.</p>
